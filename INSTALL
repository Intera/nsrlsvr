Installation instructions:

0.  Please use official releases over the git master branch.  The
    git master branch isn't guaranteed to work properly.

1.  Download the latest minimal RDS from http://www.nsrl.nist.gov.
    This file will likely be named "rds_XYZm.zip", where XYZ is the
    version number and the 'm' stands for 'minimal'.

2.  Uncompress it and keep track of where your NSRLFile.txt is.
    (Note: OS X lacks support for large ZIP files.  You may want to
    use p7zip instead on OS X.)
    
3.  Run the ./configure script.

4.  Once you've completed the "make && make install" dance, the
    following applications will be installed, but WITHOUT ANY DATA.

    * nsrlsvr, which serves hashes
    * nsrlupdate, which wipes the DB and loads a new RDS

5.  To create the data file, use nsrlupdate.  E.g., if your RDS is
    stored at /home/rjh/RDS_247m/NSRFile.txt:

    $ sudo nsrlupdate /home/rjh/RDS_247m/NSRLFile.txt

6.  You can now start nsrlsvr!
    
    $ nsrlsvr

7.  If you want to add more hashes, make sure your list of hashes

    * contains one MD5 hash per line
    * is represented as 32 hexadecimal uppercase digits
    * Has nothing else in it
    
    Then just append it to $PREFIX/share/nsrlsvr/hashes.txt.
