Installation instructions:

0.  Please use official releases over the git master branch.  The
    git master branch isn't guaranteed to work properly.

1.  nsrlsvr requires Python 2.7 or later and a C++ compiler that
    can handle the latest C++14 spec.  Recent versions of Clang
    and G++ work well.

2.  Download the latest minimal RDS from http://www.nsrl.nist.gov.
    This file will likely be named "rds_XYZm.zip", where XYZ is the
    version number and the 'm' stands for 'minimal'.

3.  Uncompress it and keep track of where your NSRLFile.txt is.
    (Note: OS X lacks support for large ZIP files.  You may want to
    use p7zip instead on OS X.)
    
4a. If you're running from git's master branch, run bootstrap.sh.

4b. Run the ./configure script.

5.  Once you've completed the "make && make install" dance, the
    following applications will be installed:

    * nsrlsvr, which serves hashes
    * nsrlupdate, which wipes the DB and loads a new RDS
    
    However, no hash list has been installed.  You must do this 
    (as explained in the next step) before using nsrlsvr.

6.  To create the data file, use nsrlupdate.  E.g., if your RDS is
    stored at /home/rjh/RDS_247m/NSRFile.txt:

    $ sudo nsrlupdate /home/rjh/RDS_247m/NSRLFile.txt

7.  You can now start nsrlsvr!
    
    $ nsrlsvr

8.  If you want to add more hashes, make sure your list of hashes

    * contains one MD5 hash per line
    * is represented as 32 hexadecimal uppercase digits
    * Has nothing else in it
    
    Then just append it to $PREFIX/share/nsrlsvr/hashes.txt.
