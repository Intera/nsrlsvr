Installation instructions:

1.  Download the latest minimal RDS from http://www.nsrl.nist.gov.
    This file will likely be named "rds_XYZm.zip", where XYZ is the
    version number and the 'm' stands for 'minimal'.
    
2.  Run the ./configure script.

3.  Once you've completed the "make && make install" dance, the
    following applications will be installed:

    * nsrlsvr, which serves hashes
    * nsrlupdate, which wipes the DB and loads a new RDS
    * nsrlappend, which adds new hashes to an existing DB

4.  As an example of how it can be used:

    $ md5deep -rco f /path/to/evil/files > evil_dataset.txt
    $ ./configure && make && sudo make install
    $ sudo nsrlupdate evil_dataset.txt

    Or, if you just want to use an RDS located somewhere (e.g.,
    /home/rjh/Downloads/rds_244m.zip):

    $ ./configure && make && sudo make install
    $ sudo nsrlupdate /home/rjh/Downloads/rds_244m.zip

    Finally, start nsrlsvr by something like:
    
    $ nsrlsvr -t 1800
    
    You've started the server and instructed it to automatically
    shut down after a half-hour of inactivity.
