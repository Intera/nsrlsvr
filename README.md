nsrlsvr
=======
nsrlsvr is a tool to facilitate looking up data in the National Software
Reference Library (NSRL).  It's in a 1.1 state, which means it's unlikely
to break in two if you look at it the wrong way but still may not be as
stable as you'd like.

Installation instructions are found in the INSTALL file.  Please read them.
Due to the size of the NSRL's reference data set (RDS), installing nsrlsvr
is a little bit more involved than one would like.  It isn't hard: it's just
not quite a configure, make, make install dance.
