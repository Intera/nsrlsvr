{"name":"Nsrlsvr","tagline":"Serves NSRL RDS hashes","body":"# nsrlsvr\r\nThe latest version is 1.6RC1.\r\n\r\n## What’s nsrlsvr?\r\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) maintains the National Software Reference Library (NSRL) — a giant compendium of software contributed by vendors.  It’s not a library in the sense that you can check things out from it, though: it’s more a library that you can check to see whether a given file already exists.  All the system files from Windows 7 are in the NSRL, as is the latest releases of Firefox and Opera and Chrome, Winamp and…\r\n\r\nIt's large, really large: over forty million distinct hashes.\r\n\r\n## What’s the RDS?\r\nThe Reference Data Set (RDS) is a list of hashes for all of the files maintained within the NSRL.  It’s over forty million hashes, each one corresponding to a known piece of software.  This isn’t to say everything listed is known good, known safe, or anything like that — just that it’s known.\r\n\r\n## Why is the RDS important?\r\nForensic investigators, first responders and technical support staff often have a needle-in-a-haystack problem: of all the files on a given storage medium they are probably only interested in a handful.  A good way to begin is by finding out what things may be ignored.  The odds are excellent that a file present in the RDS is of no real interest to the investigator.\r\n\r\n## What does `nsrlsvr` do?\r\nIt keeps track of 40 million hash values in an in-memory dataset and allows users to query that set at extremely high volume.  This allows an investigator using an NSRL tool (such as `nsrllookup`) to winnow through large numbers of files in a very short period of time.\r\n\r\n## Who wrote it?\r\nI did — Rob Hansen, or rjhansen on GitHub.
