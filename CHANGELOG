1.1.4: March 4, 2013
    * Restored the ability to use lowercase hex symbols in custom
      datasets.

1.1.1: February 22, 2013
    * Code cleanups.  Now has better support for using custom datasets.
      Less dependence on scripts for building.

1.1: May 2, 2012
    * Supports version 2 of the wire protocol, which introduces new
      commands: STATUS (gives server status), BYE (what it says),
      UPSHIFT (attempt to negotiate to a more recent protocol) and
      DOWNSHIFT (negotiate to a lower protocol).  Version 2 also
      supports multiple QUERY commands in a single connection, which
      helps a lot when fighting off port exhaustion.
    * Switched from blocking I/O to poll()-based I/O.  This helps
      deal with the out-of-control system loads that some users
      were seeing.
    * Uses RDS 2.36

1.0.6: January 20, 2012
    * Discovered that Win32 I/O redirection didn't work at all.
      Whoops.  This got fixed.

1.0.5: January 17, 2012
    * 1.0.4 added a bad regex that didn't match as much as it
      should have.  This had the effects of stripping SHA-1 hashes
      down to 128 bits.  Whoops.
    * Now compiles on FreeBSD 9.0.
    * nsrlparse became nsrlparse.py
    * nsrllookup became nsrllookup.py
    * Fixed documentation to reflect these name changes

1.0.4: January 3, 2012
    * Added a preflight script to help in development.  This has no
      effect on end-users.
    * Removed a bit of debugging output that was accidentally left
      in.
    * Moved the 'populate' script to 'nsrlparse' and added it to
      the list of installed files
    * MD5 is now fully supported, as is interoperability with
      md5deep.

1.0.3: January 3, 2012
    * Fixed an interoperability bug with sha1deep.

1.0.2: December 30, 2011
    * Ubuntu 11.10 complains about handler.cc, on account of how
      there are some write() calls that aren't checked for returning
      a -1.  Virtually all of those were superfluous warnings: one
      could possibly have created an intermittent error sooner or
      later.  They have all been patched, and it now compiles cleanly
      on Ubuntu 11.10.

1.0.1: December 30, 2011
    * nsrllookup had a bug that would become manifest while querying
      millions of records.  Now nsrllookup breaks it up into blocks
      of 4096 queries (a maximum of 164k of data per connection).
      This will hopefully improve performance for those times when
      you want to push millions of queries to the server.

1.0: December 30, 2011
    * First ready-for-the-users release.  The only new feature over
      the release candidate series is a much improved installation
      procedure.
    * It should be possible to make RPMs, Debian packages, or
      what-have-you, since the install process is now bog-standard
      GNU ./configure && make && make install

1.0rcX: December, 2011
    * Ready for limited beta testing.  The only change visible to
      end users was introducing support for OS X 10.6.
    * A bug that prevented reliable functioning on Fedora and OpenSUSE
      was found and crushed.
    * The internals were ported from a very C-like C++ subset to a
      much more C++ code style.  This reduced our dependency on GNU
      getline(), which had been the major obstacle to OS X 10.6
      support.

0.9: December, 2011
    * Successfully tested nsrlsvr with the full NIST NSRL RDS on a 4Gb
      Apple iMac.  It made it completely unusable as a desktop, but was
      able to successfully service requests.
