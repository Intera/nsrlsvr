  - RedJack's been kind enough to let me hack on nsrlquery during
    business hours during lulls in work.  Thanks, guys.  It's immensely
    appreciated.

  - Proposed the original "you know, there ought to be a way..." that
    led to nsrlquery
  - helped make nsrlquery work on OS X 10.6
  - noticed more bugs than can quickly be listed here  :)

  - Early adopters get to bleed on the cutting edge, and he shed more
    than his due.  Thanks, Mark.  Hopefully it works better now.  :)
