<h2>What’s nsrlsvr?</h2>

<p>The National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST) maintains the National Software Reference Library (NSRL) — a giant compendium of software contributed by vendors.  It’s not a library in the sense that you can check things out from it, though: it’s more a library that you can check to see whether a given file already exists.  All the system files from Windows 7 are in the NSRL, as is the latest releases of Firefox and Opera and Chrome, Winamp and…</p>

<p>It's large, really large: almost thirty million distinct files.</p>

<h2>What’s the RDS?</h2>

<p>The Reference Data Set (RDS) is a list of hashes for all of the files maintained within the NSRL.  Thirty million hashes, each one corresponding to a known piece of software.  This isn’t to say everything listed is known good, known safe, or anything like that — just that it’s known.</p>

<h2>Why is the RDS important?</h2>

<p>Forensic investigators, first responders and technical support staff often have a needle-in-a-haystack problem: of all the files on a given storage medium they are probably only interested in a handful.  A good way to begin is by finding out what things may be ignored.  The odds are excellent that a file present in the RDS is of no real interest to the investigator.</p>

<h2>What does <code>nsrlsvr</code> do?</h2>

<p>It keeps track of 30 million hash values in an in-memory dataset and allows users to query that set at extremely high volume.  This allows an investigator using an NSRL tool (such as <code>nsrllookup</code>) to winnow through large numbers of files in a very short period of time.</p>
