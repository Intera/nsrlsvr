.Nm nsrlupdate
.Nd updates nsrlsvr's hash database
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm nsrlupdate
.Op Ar rds-file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
nsrlupdate is used to replace an existing nsrlsvr hash database with the
contents of a new NSRL RDS file.  These files, which may be downloaded
from http://www.nsrl.nist.gov, are released in ZIP format every few
months.

To keep your hash database up-to-date, periodically download the latest
NSRL RDS minimal dataset (normally named rds_XYZ.zip) and run 
nsrlupdate /path/to/rds_XYZ.zip.  Be prepared to wait a while: it's a
big dataset.

nsrlupdate will wipe out the current contents of the hash database, so
be careful if you've used nsrlappend to add your own custom dataset!
