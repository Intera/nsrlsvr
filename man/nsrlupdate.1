.Sh NAME
.Nm nsrlupdate
.Nd updates nsrlsvr's hash database
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm nsrlupdate
.Op Ar NSRLFile.txt
.Sh DESCRIPTION
nsrlupdate is used to replace an existing nsrlsvr hash database with the
contents of a new NSRL RDS file.  These files, which may be downloaded
from http://www.nsrl.nist.gov, are released in ZIP format every few
months.

To keep your hash database up-to-date, periodically download the latest
NSRL RDS minimal dataset (normally named rds_XYZ.zip) and extract the
contents into a temporary directory.  Somewhere in that temporary
directory you'll find a file called "NSRLFile.txt"; make note of the path
to it.  Then call nsrlupdate, passing the path to NSRLFile.txt as an 
argument, and be prepared to wait for a while.

nsrlupdate requires a lot of memory.  Try to avoid running it on systems
with under 8Gb RAM, as painful swapping will almost certainly occur.

nsrlupdate will wipe out the current contents of the hash database, so
be careful if you've appended your own custom dataset.
